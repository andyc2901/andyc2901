### Hi there, I'm Andrew, Welcome to my GitHub!
## About Me
I'm currently a **junior data engineer** in training with Sparta Global! Before that, I studied Physics with Astronomy at the University of Nottingham, where I became proficient in both Python and MATLAB. If you'd like to know more about the projects I completed at university or the exercises I'm working through with Sparta, be sure to check out some of my Repositories!
